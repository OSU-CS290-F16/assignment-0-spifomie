                <h3>What challenges did you have?</h3>
                I had some challenges (and still do) figuring out how to use git, and
                how to even use my person webpage.
                <br>
                <h3> What did you learn?</h3>
                I learned how to use some basic HTML.
                <br>
                <h3>What resources were helpful?</h3>
                Honestly no resources were really helpful. I felt like I was stumbling the
                whole way through.
